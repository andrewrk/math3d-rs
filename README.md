# matrix4-rs

A simple library for computer-graphics matrix calculations, because I'm not
smart and/or educated enough to understand the fancy generalized linear algebra
libraries.

This library only has these types:

 * Matrix4
 * Vector4

It only supports operations on these types that I personally understand. If you
make a pull request that adds more linear algebra, you have to teach me what it
does before I'll merge it.
